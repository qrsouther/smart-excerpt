# Obsolete Migration Details

> **Note:** This migration workflow was used for the initial production installation. It is preserved here for historical reference but is no longer needed for ongoing operations.

## 🔄 MultiExcerpt to Blueprint App Migration

### Migration Overview

This project includes tools to migrate existing Confluence pages from the MultiExcerpt macro plugin to Blueprint App. The migration was successfully completed for a test page with 147 MultiExcerpt macros.

### What the Migration Does

1. **Clones MultiExcerpt Macros** - Creates Blueprint App Source macros alongside existing MultiExcerpt macros
2. **Preserves Content** - Copies all content, including rich text formatting, from MultiExcerpt to Blueprint App
3. **Assigns UUIDs** - Generates unique identifiers for each excerpt for ID-based referencing
4. **Bulk Initialization** - Populates Forge storage with all excerpt data and metadata
5. **Enables Admin Features** - Makes all excerpts available in the Admin UI with full functionality

### Migration Scripts

The following scripts are included in the project root:

#### Core Migration Scripts
- **`clone-macros.js`** - Clones MultiExcerpt macros to Blueprint App Source macros on a page
- **`migrate-content.js`** - Updates page content via Confluence API (optional migration path)
- **`migrate-macros.js`** - Main migration orchestrator (combines clone + content operations)
- **`fix-excerpt-ids.js`** - Assigns unique UUIDs to cloned excerpts

#### Reference Data
- **`blueprint-app-name-uuid-mapping.csv`** - Critical mapping file containing excerpt names, UUIDs, and categories for all 147 migrated excerpts

### Migration Process for Corporate Deployment

When ready to migrate to your corporate Confluence instance (seatgeek.atlassian.net), follow these steps:

#### Prerequisites
```bash
# Required environment variables
export CONFLUENCE_EMAIL="your.email@company.com"
export CONFLUENCE_API_TOKEN="your-api-token"
```

#### Step 1: Clone Macros to Target Page
```bash
# Clone all MultiExcerpt macros to Blueprint App Source macros
node clone-macros.js --page-id YOUR_CORPORATE_PAGE_ID
```

#### Step 2: Assign UUIDs
```bash
# Generate and assign unique IDs to each excerpt
node fix-excerpt-ids.js --page-id YOUR_CORPORATE_PAGE_ID
```

This will create a new CSV mapping file with your corporate page's excerpts.

#### Step 3: Bulk Initialize Excerpts in Forge Storage

1. **Add bulk initialization resolver to `src/index.js`** (if not already present)
2. **Update the UUID mapping** in the resolver with your new CSV data
3. **Update `sourcePageId`** from test page ID `80150529` to your corporate page ID
4. **Deploy to production:**
   ```bash
   forge deploy --environment production
   ```

5. **Access the Admin UI** in your corporate Confluence
6. **Click "Bulk Initialize All Excerpts"** button
7. **Verify** all 147 excerpts appear in the Admin page list

#### Step 4: Verify Migration Success

After bulk initialization:
- ✅ Admin page should list all 147 excerpts
- ✅ "View Source" buttons should navigate to corporate page
- ✅ Excerpt categories should be properly assigned
- ✅ Check All Sources should show all excerpts as active

### Important Notes for Corporate Migration

1. **Page ID Hardcoding** - The test implementation hardcodes page ID `80150529` (qrsouther.atlassian.net). You must update this to your corporate page ID in:
   - `bulkInitializeAllExcerpts` resolver in `src/index.js`
   - Any other references to sourcePageId

2. **Environment Differences** - Test instance is on `qrsouther.atlassian.net`, production will be on `seatgeek.atlassian.net`

3. **UUID Preservation** - Keep the `blueprint-app-name-uuid-mapping.csv` file as a backup reference for all excerpt UUIDs

4. **Content Format** - Migration scripts handle Confluence Storage Format (XML) to ADF conversion automatically

5. **Bulk Init Considerations** - The bulk initialization resolver:
   - Creates individual `excerpt:{uuid}` storage entries
   - Updates the central `excerpt-index` for Admin UI listing
   - Sets `sourcePageId` for "View Source" functionality
   - Assigns categories from the mapping CSV

### Migration Script Details

#### `clone-macros.js`
- Fetches page content via Confluence REST API v2
- Parses Confluence Storage Format XML
- Finds all `multiexcerpt-macro` instances
- Creates corresponding `blueprint-app-source` macros
- Preserves all content formatting

#### `fix-excerpt-ids.js`
- Scans page for Blueprint App Source macros without UUIDs
- Generates UUID v4 for each excerpt
- Extracts excerpt names from macro parameters
- Creates CSV mapping file for bulk initialization
- Updates page with assigned UUIDs

#### Bulk Initialization Resolver
Located in `src/index.js`, the `bulkInitializeAllExcerpts` resolver:
- Reads UUID mappings from embedded CSV data
- Creates storage entries for each excerpt
- Populates excerpt metadata (name, category, sourcePageId)
- Updates excerpt-index for Admin UI
- Returns success/failure counts

### Troubleshooting Migration

**If Admin page shows 0 excerpts after initialization:**
- Ensure `excerpt-index` is updated in bulk init resolver
- Check browser console for storage errors
- Verify bulk init resolver returned success count

**If "View Source" doesn't work:**
- Verify `sourcePageId` is set correctly in excerpt entries
- Check that page ID matches your corporate page

**If content preview is blank:**
- This is expected - content preview requires Confluence Storage Format to ADF conversion
- Users can still edit content on source page via "View Source"

### CSV Mapping File Format

```csv
Excerpt Name,UUID,Category
"Project Evaluation","a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-1234-567890abcdef","General"
"Technical Stack","f1e2d3c4-b5a6-9870-4321-fedcba098765","Technical"
...
```

Each row contains:
- **Excerpt Name** - The name from the MultiExcerpt macro
- **UUID** - Unique identifier (generated by fix-excerpt-ids.js)
- **Category** - Organization category (General, Technical, etc.)
